# The Francois Project
a Java-based AI modeled after human psychology/behavioral biology

Welcome! Thank you for taking time to look at this project. 
<P> <img src="http://blogs.lib.utexas.edu/texlibris/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/HAL-9000.jpg">
<P> Even with his -- *tiny* capacity for murder, everyone who watched <i>2001</i> probably wished they could have their own HAL.
AI, as destructive as some people show, is actually quite cool.
<P>One Siri came out, I think everyone was amazed. I would sit with my iPad, seeing how Siri would react to when I'd say certain 
things. Then there are other cool things people have made, like Cleverbot. But when you play these with these things for a while,
  problems will emergy
  
  Siri:
  <ul>
  <li>Siri is cool because it was a trailblazer and even then was high quality. It has a voice interface, which makes the 
  conversation much more personal. On top of that, it isn't just some digitally generated monotone; the voice is really human and 
  very fluid. </li>
  <li>Siri is designed mainly for *productivity*. Apple has made attempts to make Siri fun by hiding some predetermined jokes. 
  Though they are meant to be hidden, any internet search will reveal all. Apple has designed almost everything Siri would say. And,
  getting to the point, it is meant to be productive, not entertaining. The whole idea is that you can ask it to look for movies, do
  a calculation, change a setting or text a friend. That's why they call such things *personal assistants*. Though Siri is very useful,
  it would never pass a Turing Test.
  </ul>
  
  Cleverbot:
  <ul>
  <li> I was truly amazed when I encountered Cleverbot. It is remarkably humanlike, and according to their website, it has 
  gotten up to 59% human on Turing Tests (note that this is a better version than what they host on the web). Though I don't know
  about the development of Cleverbot, I can safely assume most of what Cleverbot says isn't made beforehand. Cleverbot comes up with 
  it on the spot, and it's good. Their not-so-secret secret is that Cleverbot learns from conversations with actual humans, and imitates them.
  It's like how humans change; by interacting with other humans. It is pretty cool. </li>
  <li>There isn't much I can say against Cleverbot. It learns from humans, but we still have to keep in mind that humans can
  be unpredictable... Also, the interface is definetely not the best it can be. But I do want to say that Cleverbot isn't really
  useful for anything; it's just there as a showcase.
  </ul>
  
  Taking all this in, we at Operation Mushroom thought, why not make our own one. We want to take the best of both worlds, and
  learn from the mistakes of both. We want to make something with the personality of Cleverbot, but with the productivity and
  user-friendliness of Siri, and boost this up. And we want it to be web-based, so all can access it. It will also be made in Java.
  
  This us what we plan to do:
  <ol>
  <li><b>Build the framework:</b> We want to build a basic interface, where we can input information, the software can process it,
  and spit out an output. The very basics, and by no means AI. </li>
  <li><b>Tier One:</b> We will build the very basic framework for the AI, machine learning, and neural networks, and have a very
  basic type-in interface. This would be as good as Siri or Cleverbot, or at a lower level. </li>
  <li><b>Tier Two - Improved Realism:</b> This is a revision of the AI, with improved machine learning and neural networks, and
  aspects such as memory, personality, etc. We are also going to be doing our research on behavioral biology and emulating it here.
  This should (hopefully) be better quality then the usual. </li>
  <li><b>Tier Three:</b> We will add primitive voice capability, while still improving the AI.</li>
  <li><b>Productivity and APIs</b>One of the goals of the Francois Project is productivity, and we of course cannot add support
  for every thing you want, so we will add an API so you can let Francois do whatever tasks you need.</li>
  <li><b>Tier Four - Tying up Loose Ends</b> Here is where we head for a somewhat final product. More productivity support; by 
  now we should have a good audio component; release a web based and downloadable version; etc. etc. We will of course still work 
  on the project.
